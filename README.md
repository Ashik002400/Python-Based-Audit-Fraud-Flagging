# Python-Based-Fraud-Audit-Simulation
This project simulates a real-world audit risk assessment and fraud detection workflow using Python and the PaySim dataset (6M+ mobile-money transactions). It applies audit-style logic to identify fraud flags, calculate risk scores, and visualize red flags in transaction patterns.
